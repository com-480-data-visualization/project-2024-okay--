        <p>The Olympic Games are much more than just a sporting competition; they are a global gathering where each country brings its own personal touch. Since their resurgence in 1896, these games have celebrated unity, diversity, and human excellence.

   <h2>Gender Representation Over the Years</h2>
    <div class="intro-block">
        <p>In this visualization, we can see a global map that highlights the gender representation of athletes in the Summer Olympics over the years. The map uses a color scale to represent the ratio of female to male athletes in each country, where darker colors signify a more balanced participation between genders, and lighter colors indicate male-dominated teams. This map is particularly interesting as it reveals the progress and setbacks in gender equality across different nations. By observing the changes in color distribution over the years, we can identify which countries have made significant strides towards gender parity and which ones still have room for improvement. Such insights are valuable for understanding the broader social and cultural shifts regarding women‚Äôs participation in sports globally.</p>
